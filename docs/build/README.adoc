https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp[Main Repository] | link:../[List of Content]

The production build is the one that's going to be published on Google Play, respectively the App Store. To deploy the application, a production build is first needed. After the generation of those builds Android Studio and XCode need to be used to complete the deployment process.

=== Generating the Android Production Build
Android Builds can be created as an *.apk*-file (application package) or *.aab*-file (app bundle). An app bundle is a publishing format that includes all the appâ€™s compiled code and resources, and defers APK generation and signing to Google Play. The .apk-files are the packaging format which eventually will be installed on the device. These can also be installed manually on a physical Android device.

*To generate a single .apk-file run:*
....
npm run build_apk
....

*The generated .akp-file can be found here:* + 
*`link:../../../../tree/main/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release[android/app/build/outputs/apk/release]`*

*To generate a .aab-file run:*
....
npm run build_aab
....

*The generated .aap-file can be found here:* + 
*`link:../../../../tree/main/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release[android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release]`*
