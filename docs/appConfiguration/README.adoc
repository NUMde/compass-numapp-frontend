= Configuring the React Native Client for Development and Production Environments

https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp[Main Repository] | link:../[List of Content]

The application configuration provides options that can influence how the app behaves in the development- and the production environment.:

* *Development Options*
* *Login Options*
* *Local Storage Identifier*
* *UI Related Options*
* *Evaluation Options*
* *Encryption options*

== Setting up the Custom Configuration Files

During installation the config files in link:../../../../tree/main/compass-numapp-template/src/config[./src/config] are created. Those are:

* *devConfig.js* for various development and debugging options
* *appConfig.js* for settings that also apply to release builds
* *theme.js* to configure the style of the app an its components

Should this step fail, you can manually create them by copying or renaming the sample files

While the options in 'devConfig.js' are only relevant for development (meaning, they have no effect on release builds),
the options in appConfig.js are relevant fot both development and production.
Hence, only 'appConfig' will be checked into git to prevent unnecessary conflicts between different development setups.

=== Development Options
these options are configured in 'devConfig.js'

* *automateQrLogin:*
** This skips the login by QR-Code after 500ms
* *automateQrLoginSubjectId:*
** The subject-id for the automated login
* *showEraseAll:*
** Shows a button to erase all data (in the about-menu)
* *showLogout:*
** Shows a button to log out the user (in the about-menu)
* *logPureResponse:*
** This logs out the response-json (that is being send to the server) parsed as an object in the developer console
* *logPureResponseJSON:*
** Logs out the response-json in the developer console
* *logEncryptedResponse:*
** Logs out the encrypted response-json in the developer console
* *useLocalQuestionnaireInsteadOfTheReceivedOne:*
** Used the locally available link:../../../../tree/main/compass-numapp-template/src/assets/files/questionnaire.json[questionnaire.json] instead of the procured one from the backend. This is useful for testing purposes
* *skipIncomingQuestionnaireCheck:*
** This skips the id-comparison of an incoming questionnaire. This is useful should you want to carry over the state of a partially answered questionnaire using the local questionnaire instead of the one coming from the server

== Development & Production Options

=== Login Options
The  qr-code used to log the user in is formed like the following example:
[.float-group]
--
image:./images/qrCode.png[auto, 175, float="left",]
// Define float role, instead of attribute.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "AppIdentifier":  "COMPASS",
    "SubjectId":	"subjectId"
}
----
The Login options contain the attribute-names necessary to check the appIdentifier and to extract the subjectId. This way you can generate QR Code that contain your own AppIdentifier.
--
 
* *qrCodeAttributeHoldingTheAppIdentifier:*
** The name of the attribute in the qr-code holding the app-identifier. If the scanned code contains such an attribute, the app-identifier will be checked against the next attribute:
* *appIdentifier:*
** The app-identifier itself. Should the one coming from the qr-code and the one defined with this attribute match, then we know that we're looking at a compatible qr-code. The only thing left to extract ist the:
* *qrCodeAttributeHoldingTheUserName:*
** The name of the attribute in the qr-code holding the subject-id

=== Local Storage Identifiers
In order for the app to function properly it must persist various values. For that purpose https://github.com/emeraldsanto/react-native-encrypted-storage[React Native Encrypted Storage] is being utilized. This module provides a wrapper around Android's https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences[EncryptedSharedPreferences] and https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services[iOS' Keychain]. This ensures the encryption of the locally persisted data.

The following values carry the strings used to generate the names of the values belonging to the compass-application. The names are generated here: **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/services/localStorage/localStorage.js[src/services/localStorage/localStorage.js]`**


* *kioskModeData*
** used to store data when app is build for kiosk mode

* *userLanguage*
** used to store the language chosen by the user (in case it differs from the system language)

=== Push Notifications
Contains options concerning the push notification service

* *connectToFCM*
** if set to true the app tries to connect to a FCM instance that in turn will be able to send out push notifications reminding the participants to open the app. 

* *reconnectOnEachUserUpdate*
** if set to true the app tries to establish the connection with each user update  


=== UI Related Options
Groups some minor UI related options that does not belong into the theme.

* *allowAccessToLegalInformationScreen*
** This adds another LinkList to the About-Screen, which navigates to **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/screens/about/legalInformationScreen.js[LegalInformationScreen]`**. The content of that screen can be configured through the **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/config/textConfig.js[textConfiguration]`**
* *scaleFontsFkt*
** This function is meant to provide an additional means of scaling the fonts of the application. It is used sporadically throughout the application.
* *scaleUiFkt*
** This function is meant to provide an additional means of scaling ui-elements of the application. It is used sporadically throughout the application.

=== Evaluation Options
Before encrypting a questionnaire response, a set of parameters is determined to be sent additionally to the server (alongside the response). This is due to the fact that the encrypted response cannot be looked into on the server, because it is - well - encrypted. To know how to ascertain those values a ruleset is needed. This should be included in the response coming from the server when calling the **getUser**-Endpoint. 

Should that be **not** the case, the defaultRulesConfig will be loaded instead, which looks like this:

[source, JSON]
----
defaultRulesConfig: [
		{
			"type": "basicTrigger",
			"rules": {
				"compass-0-04": [
					'01# Ja'
				]
			}
		},

		{
			"type": "specialTrigger",
			"rules": {
				"compass-0-03-02": [
					'02# positives Ergebnis'
				]	
			}
		}
	],
----

Of course, you could update the defaultRulesConfig to your liking and just not provide the ruleset by the server. This way you would have static (meaning hardcoded) ruleset.

* *defaultRulesConfig*
** The default values, should there be no ruleset coming from the server with the user-update. Each entry contains definitions of questions (from the questionnaire) and their corresponding answers that would trigger that particular rule of the return object of the function createResponseJSON(), located in **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/services/questionnaireAnalyzer/questionnaireAnalyzer.js[src/services/questionnaireAnalyzer/questionnaireAnalyzer.js]`**
* *defaultReportAttribute*
** The name of the attribute used to signal a special report

=== Encryption Options
Before a questionnaire-response can be sent to the backend it must be encrypted. For that reason a **RSA Public Certificate String** must be available. Such a certificate should be provided by the backend with a user update, but if not, the **defaultRecipientCertificatePemString** will be used instead. As the name suggests, a complete PEM string is needed.

* *defaultRecipientCertificatePemString*
** The default recipient key (in case nothing comes from the server)

IMPORTANT: There must always be a code available. The application will try to access it when sending out a questionnaire-response

TIP: A RSA-Key-Size of at least **2048B** is recommended

=== Kiosk mode
The frontend client comes with a built-in kiosk mode. This means that the app can be set up in a way that it basically provides its own mock-backend to simulate a basic workflow within the app. The purpose is to demonstrate the capabilities of the NUM-App to new audiences.

To activate the kiosk mode, open up the file **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/config/kioskApiConfig.js[kioskApiConfig.js]`** and set the value `kioskModeIsActive` to `true`.
The app will then accept the credentials of the predefined user (also found in **`link:../../../../tree/main/src/config/kioskApiConfig.js[kioskApiConfig.js]`**).

A working APK (incl. a matching qr-code) can be found under **`link:../../../../tree/main/DEMO%20APK[DEMO APK]`**.
