= Updating Available Languages and the Content of the React Native Client

https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp[Main Repository] | link:../[List of Content]

== Setting up the individual Languages
The strings utilized in the app, as well as other aspects of the react-native client can be adjusted to your needs. The project comes with a set of configuration files that allow for quick and individual changes. The files responsible for the currently used strings are located under *`link:../../../../tree/main/src/CUSTOMIZATION/translations[src/CUSTOMIZATION/translations]`*. Each file represents an available set of strings for a given language. If you want to add a language you need to add another file named like the language-code it represents and then add a matching entry in the `availableLanguageFiles` object in then file *`link:../../../../tree/main/src/services/localization/localization.js[src/services/localization/localization.js]`*.

TIP: Likewise, If you want to remove a language, just remove the according entry in that object.

TIP: These are Javascript strings. That means you can use escape characters and sequences like "*\n*" (would produce a line break). 

TIP: Template literals are also possible - meaning you can write multi-line content without using escape sequences (see the attribute "content"):

== Adding / Altering / Removing Entries to the About-Screen
The About Screen (can be reached by clicking on the burger menu in top right corner) provides three kinds of links that can be displayed:

=== Link to the Legal-Information-Screen

[cols=>1d;2d,width=100%, frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|image:./images/legal.gif[auto, 300]
|This will take the user to a screen dedicated to the legal content that the app must contain in certain areas. The content of that page is dependent on the value of the property *'legalInformation'* of your language file:

*'content'* holds the legal text as literal string. This way you can add it in an already formatted form.

TIP: The access to the Legal-Information-Screen can be forbidden by setting the attribute *'allowAccessToLegalInformationScreen'* to *false*

TIP: If you do not want to use the Legal-Information-Screen you can just deactivate it and use a WebView-Link or a Redirect-Link instead.

=== WebView Links

[cols=>1d;2d,width=100%, frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|image:./images/webview.gif[auto, 300]
|This will take the user to the *WebView-Screen*. That screen will open up an URI provided by your language file and then renders it below the banner. The content appears to be part of the app, but is indeed loaded from an external source. You can set that up to be anything you need. 

To add another WebView-Link to the About-Screen, all you have to do is add another object (like the ones already there) to the WebViews-Array provided by your language file. Of course, you can also just edit or remove the existing ones:

=== Browser Links

[cols=>1d;2d,width=100%, frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|image:./images/redirect.gif[auto, 300]
|This last type of link will also open an URI defined by your language file. But it will open it in the local web-browser of the user. Before that, a modal will tell the user that he is now being redirected.

To add another Browser-Link to the About-Screen, all you have to do is add another object (like the ones already there) to the ModalLink-Array provided by your language file. Of course, you can also just edit or remove the existing ones:
